# smalld-examples

This repository contains exampes in various languages of bots made using
[SmallD](https://github.com/princesslana/smalld).
For instructions on how to run the examples see the README.md in each
languages folder.

Some common bots that may be in each:
* PingBot - reponds with "pong" when "++ping" is sent
* CatBot - responds with a random cat image from http://aws.random.cat/meow (demonstrates usage of multipart POST)
* CompositeBot - an example of combining multiple bots into one. Although this is not a feature of SmallD it shows that SmallD does allow this style of development.
